# Backend inspired bootstrap theme
The new lightweight backend modules give you the ability to use simple HTML and CSS to create your modules layout. If you are using Bootstrap as your frontend framework we recommend our Bootstrap custom theme for proper appearance within the backend.

## Usage
1.  Go to [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com) and hit 'Customize' to get your custom build.
2.  Import the `config.json` to apply the main color configuration. Make sure that you have checked all your desired components. Download your custom build.
3.  Create your Bootstrap HTML template and place the `bootstrap-theme-shopware.css` right after the Bootstrap core CSS.

## Supported components
